              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>
                With the growing number of single people, social support and
                connections are becoming increasingly important for health and
                emotional welfare. It is especially challenging for young adults
                to find friends after finishing their studies.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="part-2">
              <h4>Project Goal</h4>
              <p>
                MVP prototype for an engaging product that addresses the social
                needs of younger population by connecting people online based on
                shared interests, views and common goals.

            </div>
            <div class="part-3">
              <h4>Target Audience</h4>
              <p>
                Young adults (23-35) who have time and interest to build and
                cultivate online relationships with the primary focus on the
                female audience.

            <div class="part-4">
              <h4>Approach</h4>
              <p>
                The human-centered Design Thinking process helped me stay on
                track during multiple iterations and make sure that my design
                decisions were supported by user feedback.

                <h4>Google Trends</h4>
                <p>
                  Google Trends show a somewhat bumpy yet stable interest in the
                  search query "make friends" over the last ten years. The
                  upward general trend predicts a further growing demand in the
                  nearest future.

            <h4>Desk Research Findings</h4>
            <p class="short-text">
              Each user persona has a somewhat similar yet recognizable journey
              patterns. Both user journeys reveal that the three first steps are
              crucial as they are relevant for all users. The forth step is
              nonetheless equally important as it provides each user groups with
              the main functionality, required to reach their goals.

                <h4>Interviewing</h4>
                <p>
                  When I had a clearer picture of the target audience, I decided
                  to check my insights and see if and what troubles the target
                  group experiences when it comes to friendships. So I conducted
                  three semi-structured interviews with target users based on
                  their demographics and goals.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <p>
                  Questions were organized into three categories: kickoff
                  questions, online experience, and friendships in real life.
                  During the interviews, I used the 5 whys tactic, avoided any
                  leading questions and asked about past (best, worst, last)
                  experience instead.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-column-container blue-bg">
              <div>
                <p>
                  It was inspiring to hear that the interview participants were
                  excited about the idea of seeking new ways to bring people
                  together:
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p class="italic-style">
                  “Friendship apps are needed for anyone like me – over 25 years
                  old”
                </p>
                <p class="italic-style">
                  “It is really sad there is no friendship apps out there.
                  Single or not, you still need friends”
                </p>
                <p class="italic-style">
                  "I don't know any friendship apps. It's really sad. Meeting
                  people at work is the only chance"

            <h4>Affinity Diagram</h4>
            <p class="short-text">
              After thematical analysis of the interview transcriptions, I
              visualized all the gathered information via an affinity map to
              find relationships between the data pieces. Based on the
              connections, I then grouped the dataset into larger themes.

            <h4>Persona</h4>
            <p class="short-text">
              I compiled the  insights from the interviews in a user persona to
              have a more coherent understanding of the primary user type.

              Before jumping straight into the ideation phase, I reviewed all
              collected data to articulate the design challenge. It will help me
              reveal gaps in the unmet user needs and start opening up for new
              ideas.

              into questions to start opening up ideas and opportunities to
              solve the challenge.

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <p class="short-text">
              Quite unexpectedly for myself I ended up with a solution which did
              not aim at making friends specifically. It was more of a mobile
              learning platform where people could look for learning buddies or
              join small study groups and thus make new contacts and
              simultaneously develop skills or passions that can bring them
              together.
            </p>
            <h4>Why AN App?</h4>
            <p class="short-text">
              I revisited the pain point section in the user journey map and
              made sure that my design idea was aligned with the troubles users
              experienced.
            </p>
            <p class="short-text">
              The interviewees' responses clearly indicated that young adults
              use social media mostly on their phones for checking messages and
              new events.
            </p>
            <p class="short-text">
              Moreover, introverted people prefer the feeling of safety, staying

              communication.

                  I then checked whether a similar solution was already
                  available for users but could not find any direct competitor.
                  Yet plenty platforms build their products around the idea of

                <h5 class="row-spacing">Color meaning</h5>
                <p>
                  Bright orange represents friendliness and stimulates mental
                  activity and blue stands for knowledge, understanding. That
                  mirrors the main app idea - making friends while learning.
                </p>
                <h5 class="row-spacing">Accessibility</h5>
                <p>
                  Blue/ orange color combination ensures good color contrast
                  (tested on a color blindness simulator).
                </p>
                <h5 class="row-spacing">Neutral colors</h5>
                <p>
                  The application mainly consists of neutral colors (black,
                  white and gray) to make it aesthetically appealing in
                  combination with any event pictures users might choose as a
                  group picture
                </p>
                <h5 class="row-spacing">Interactions</h5>
                <p>
                  Bright blue colors are used with call-to-action (CAT) buttons,
                  orange with functional and navigation elements to make them
                  stand out and stimulate intuitive interactions within the
                  application.

                <h5 class="row-spacing">Typeface</h5>
                <p>
                  Libre Franklin is a modern, playful and elegant typeface. It
                  complements the design style which is in-between fun and
                  friendly chatting yet meaningful communication and enriching
                  learning experience

                  Once I was through with the mockups, I conducted three remote
                  moderated usability tests to explore the main functionality
                  issues that may arise during the first use. Although the test
                  participants had almost no trouble navigating the platform,
                  they still pointed out some issues/ inconsistencies that they
                  with.

                <p>
                  I used a grayscale prototype to test the user flow and
                  layouts. The lack of visual enhancements backlashed as users
                  gave negative feedback to the design and paid overall much
                  more attention to the UI drawbacks than to product usability.
                  I had to pause usability tests to make all the necessary
                  visual adjustments for the product to feel more real.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <span> Solution </span>: Next time, I will test low-fidelity
                wireframes only with trained professionals. I will create a
                colorful, elaborately designed and visually appealing prototype
                for testers because they are used to deal with finished products
                only.

              <div>
                <p>
                  The application Buddy4 is both a social media and a learning
                  platform. People prefer chatting on their mobile phones but
                  learning things is more comfortable on a bigger screen like a
                  PC or a laptop.
                </p>

                <span> Solution </span>: Develop later a web version of the
                application so that users could easily share files, watch shared
                content or video chat on larger real estates.
